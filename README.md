# Multi-Armed-Bandit-
Multi-Armed Bandit implementation
Running the code is pretty simple. 
I have added these lines of code for individual plotting and change the distribution if needed. 
 
 
Plotting algorithms RUN=1 A=0  with 0==e-Greedy 1==UCB  2==grad       
To view algorithms individually Choose a different value for RUN and select algorithm with A   
 
 
Different distributions: Distribution=0   0==Gaussian, any other value for Bernoulli
